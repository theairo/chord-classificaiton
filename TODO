# Feeding real world data helped tremendously on classification real cases (going from 20% accuracy to 90%+)
# Feedign a new real instrument only made it worse (as an experiment)
# Increasing chunk size and time for note clarification to 0.5 seconds instead of 0.25 made 99% accuracy. 
# Going back to 0.25 seconds gives 90%+ accuracy
# Idea: get New Pitches + 5 main instrumets. Train on 10x augmentation on CNN. 0.3 pause.
